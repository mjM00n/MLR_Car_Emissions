# Predicting CO2 Emissions from Car Data

This report was completed as a school project for my Data 603 course in a team. My team and I conducted a multiple linear regression analysis on car data, using data obtained from the Government of Canada website. The data was based on car specifications, and included metrics such as car types, fuel type, engine cylinders, gas milage, and CO2 emissions. We used CO2 as our response variable, and attempted to model emissions based on the other variables present in the data. We utilized additive and interactive modelling through stepwise regressions to help reduce the variables in our model and come up with a solid foundation. The model was tested against assumptions of linearity, normality, independence, equal variance, multicollinearity, and outliers. Our final model had an adjusted R squared of 0.9981 with a relatively low RSE, but did not pass assumption tests for normality and homoscedasticity.
